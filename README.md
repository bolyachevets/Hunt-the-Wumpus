# Hunt-the-Wumpus
Hunt the Wumpus in Prolog: a group project for cpsc 312

To start type: play.

If facing adjacent room numbers 1, 2, 3 can do smth like this:

go 1                % will move to room 1
shoot 1             % will shoot in the direction of room 1

For now you can traverse the adjacent vertices of dodecahedron by selecting an appropriate room number from the 3 listed, followed by a period. Added pits, bats, wumpus. Hunter can sense nearby danger and shoot arrows. Can win by defeating the wumpus and lose by either falling in a pit, succuming to wumpus or running out of arrows.
