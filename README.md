Hunt the Wumpus in Prolog: a group project for cpsc 312

To start type: play.

For now you can traverse the adjacent vertices of dodecahedron by selecting an appropriate room number from the 3 listed, followed by a period. Pits and bats have been implemented. Working on hunter's senses (she can sense the pits and will be able to sense bats soon).
